        <h2> Chronic diseases</h2>
        <p>Chronic diseases/Non-communicable diseases are currently the major cause of death among adults in almost all countries and the toll is projected to increase by a further 17% in the next 10 years. Globally, approximately one in three of all adults suffer from multiple chronic conditions. Six in ten adults in the US have a chronic disease and four in ten adults have two or more. It has been calculated that, of the 58 million deaths in 2005, approximately 35 million will be as a result of chronic diseases. Health damaging behaviours - particularly tobacco use, lack of physical activity, and poor eating habits, excessive alcohol use - are major contributors to the leading chronic diseases. The leading chronic diseases in developed countries include (in alphabetical order) arthritis, cardiovascular disease eg.heart attacks and stroke, cancer eg breast and colon cancer, diabetes, epilepsy and seizures, obesity, and oral health problems. Each of these conditions plagues older adults. This rise in Chronic diseases (CDs) is a very serious situation, both for public health and for the societies and economies affected. Until recently, the impact and profile of chronic diseases have generally been insufficiently appreciated.
        The World Health Organization states that chronic diseases are not passed from person to person. They are of long duration and generally slow progression.</p>

          <h3>Diabetes</h3>
          <p>Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.</p>

           <h3>Blood Pressure</h3>
           <p>Hypertension (high blood pressure) is when the pressure in your blood vessels is too high (140/90 mmHg or higher). It is common but can be serious if not treated.

           People with high blood pressure may not feel symptoms. The only way to know is to get your blood pressure checked..</p>

              <h3>Heart Problems</h3>
              <p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age.</p>
